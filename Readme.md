# Rock, Paper, Scissors
                                                  
As a frequent games player,                      
I'd like to play rock, paper, scissors           
so that I can spend an hour of my day having fun 
                                                  
 ## *Acceptance Criteria                              
  - Can I play Player vs Computer?                
  - Can I play Computer vs Computer?              
  - Can I play a different game each time?

## *Technical Constraints/Considerations
                                                  
 - Doesn't necessarily need a flashy GUI (can be simple)                                
 - Use .NET toolset (i.e. c#) and any associated plug ins you see fit 			   
 - Use best industry practices

### Hints/Tips:

Will be looking for a scaled down version (think minimum viable product). Extend if the time allows.
No database (i.e. session stored), simple interface - 2 hours' worth of work, bear this in mind when designing
I'm not looking for a full blown thing, just something small and well crafted.
Looking for unit tests and well factored code (C#).
